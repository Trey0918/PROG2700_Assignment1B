# PROG 2700 - Assignment 1B

### PhoneWords

Create a JavaScript application that will convert a *PhoneWord* or Vanity Number (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phoneword) to a set of numbers. An example would be taking 1-800-HOLIDAY and getting 18004654329. 

The image below shows the keypad you will be emulating:

**Note:** in North America, the alphabet begins with the number 2 on the keypad. You have been provided with starter code in this repository (index.html and main.js). The code that you are asked to write should go in the function indicated called *convertPhoneWord*. The script will execute a *testCode()* function that will test your code.  Errors will be written to the console until your code is sufficient implemented. **Do not write any code outside of the area indicated.**

#### Requirements
Given any PhoneWord:
+ Ignore any non -alphanumeric characters: (), -, etc.
+ Keep any existing digits
+ Resolve a letter to a number according to the keypad image
+ Complete the *convertPhoneWord* function such that all tests pass.
